# Lore Master

## The Mythology Trivia Game

Lore Master is an interactive trivia game designed for players to test their knowledge of various mythologies from around the world. Featuring daily challenges and an all-time leaderboard, players can compete to see who reigns supreme in the world of gods and legends.

The inspiration for this project stems from my passion for mythology. I wanted to create an engaging and interactive way to spark interest in mythology while showcasing my skills in SQL databases, Flask applications, and Python. For this project, I took a measured approach, ensuring that my initial goals were attainable before expanding into more complex features. I also opted for JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, which provided a smoother experience compared to my previous use of bcrypt. I plan to continue improving the project, adding new features, and refining the existing ones to make it even better than it is now.
